                <p> 
                    Slow week for day trading and momentum. Been practicing drifting on Assetto Corsa since I'm planning to drift my car on the track end of this month. <br>
                    Just heard that DMX is now on life support and they are going to pull the plug. Drug overdose to a heart attack... RIP to an iconic legend. 
                    On the other hand, got my doggie to wear a bow tie. Also finished a sketch of a relay driver circuit and tested, the circuitry works! Just need to <br>
                    test now for long-term usage and make sure it doesn't catch on <p id="fire">fire...</p>
                </p>

                <h3> The Team's First Meetup and On Asian Hate </h3>
                <p> 
                    Today I got to meet my CSE 110 team, and we played skribbl.io for about an hour. They are awesome people, and can't wait <br>
                    to start working with all of them! Afterwards, we discussed the upcoming deliverables and what to expect for the coming week. <br>
                    Been looking at some wheels for my GT86, and now thinking about either the Enkei RPF1 or the Work CR Emotion Kiwami. <br>
                    Also saw that Boeing workers were organizing a potential strike, so I should watch for a downwards momentum coming on Monday, potentially <br>
                    go on a short position. Keep seeing more asian hate on the news, this needs to stop honestly... Ended up giving both of my grandparents some <br>
                    pepper spray and tasers that we had on hand. Sad how I have to worry about my grandparents in our current society, especially since most of the victims <br>
                    are the elderly. What a bunch of cowards.

                <p> 
                    <span> This text is spanned. </span> Today is mostly just going to be preparations for the upcoming week and finishing off my assignments that are due today. Lots of work <br>
                    which just shows that things are progressing and goals are getting closer. <br>
                    Stomach didn't feel so good today, which based on deduction is probably that OREO donut I had last night. <b> It was worth it though </b> <br>
